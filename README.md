## SpellChecker-Java
##SpellChecker uses seperate chaining hashing mechanism.

Given an input, the code will verify it exists in the dictionary of accurately spelled words.
If not, it should help in reestablishing the significance of string by certain capacities, for example, adding any character to the beginning or end of the input including or expelling a character, and revising nearby characters.

Word.txt document has not been attached that acts as a dictionary you can create it by adding random words to text file and verify the output.
